    <p>Welcome to <span>enscribe</span>, a note-taking app for tutors.</p>
</div>
<div id="introdiv">
    <p>Enscribe is a tool for tutors to share lesson notes with their students.</p>
    <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Instructors can add students to their rosters via email. Enscribe will
        automatically
        send out an email for new students to sign in.</p>
    <p>This app is for instructors who work with students one-on-one, such as music teachers who give
        private lessons, personal trainers, or academic tutors.</p>
    <p>Selecting a student will open a directory of lessons where the instructor can add lessons and view/edit their
        notes within each lesson.</p>
